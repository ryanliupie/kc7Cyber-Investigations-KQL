## CloutHaus: Social Media leads to Compromise

### Notes for investigation

#### Instagram and Email Issue

- she has her personal email <b>afomiya.storm@gmail.com</b>, in her Instagram bio. Attackers can use this email to send her phishing attempts along side impersonation. Especially since she does a ton of brand deals, an attackers email can be easily mixed in the bunch. Some things to look for whether it is a phishing attempt are: 

    - Any phrases containing or similar to "requires immediate action", "within 24 hrs". Anything with urgent requests. 
    - The email asks for sensitive information such as SIN, DOB, passwords etc.. 
    - The senders domain does not look legitimate. 
    - Generic greetings such as "Dear customer"

- She posts Q&A stories that allow attackers to send her personal questions such as "Where do you live?", "What your pets name?", "What is your mothers name?". This can be used by attackers when trying to reset an email for example. It may require security questions in regards to those answers.
